# Lab 2 - Inheritance

## Outcomes
* Enhance an existing unit test suite to increase confidence in code correctness.
* Refactor existing highly similar classes by adding a third (super-)class and leveraging inheritance.

## Description
* Look at the code for the two classes given, `TabSeparatedFile`, and `CommaSeparatedFile` and refactor the code to try to maximize re-use of common data elements and methods.
* Add new unit tests as needed to utilize new function names, etc.
* Create a new super class and extend that in the existing classes.
* Try to make the two files that were given as small as possible by forcing everything possible up into the super class.

## Trouble running the test file?
If you have difficulties getting the Junit test file to run, it might be easiest to just create a new Junit file from the Eclipse menu and copy paste the code over.
Run configurations in Eclipse can be a bit tricky and this seems to be the easiest way for a simple test suite such as this.
